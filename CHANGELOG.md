## 2.0.0 (2021-03-31)

**BREAKING CHANGES:** `+handler` and `+less` options have been removed.

**MAJOR COMMAND CHANGES:**` After creating your templated project instead of:
- `lein watch` now use `npm run watch`
- `lein shadow ...` now use `npx shadow-cljs ...`
- `lein release` now use `npm run release`

#### Changed

- Replace lein with shadow-cljs. Leiningen is still used for templating (i.e. `lein new re-frame ...`), but the resulting
output is now a pure shadow-cljs build with no dependency on Leiningen. This resolves a whole class of bugs and beginner
confusion that was being caused by the more complex Leiningen setup. It also enables users to have a `npm` or `yarn`
focused workflow for dependencies, as we no longer wrap those tools.

#### Removed

- Remove `+handler` option. Due to change from Leiningen to pure shadow-cljs. This is a client-focused template, and
it is not worthwhile for us to maintain a backend implementation when there are other templates focused on that use
case. We will not re-add this option.
- Remove `+less` option. Due to change from Leiningen to pure shadow-cljs. We might be amenable to re-adding this
if/when a shadow-cljs build hook for less is available.

## 1.5.0 (2021-03-23)

## 1.1.1 (2020-05-15)

## 1.1.0 (2020-05-14)

#### Changed

- Upgrade ClojureScript to [1.10.764](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/changes.md#110764)
- Raise minimum Leiningen version for the generated project to `2.9.0` or later. Older versions *might*
  work, but we don't test them, so we may as well specify a properly tested and supported version. The
  previous required minimum `2.5.3` is also 5 years old, so thats really old. The new minimum `2.9.0` is 
  1.25 years old already, so its reasonable.
- Upgrade shadow-cljs to 2.9.3

## 1.0.34 (2020-05-14)

#### Changed

- Upgrade `lein-shadow` to 0.2.0.
  See the [`lein-shadow` `CHANGELOG.md`](https://gitlab.com/nikperic/lein-shadow/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
  and [merge request](https://gitlab.com/nikperic/lein-shadow/-/merge_requests/3) for a full list of changes.
  See issues [#127](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-template/issues/127) and
  [#128](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-template/issues/128) for some of the background and ongoing
  discussion. Further changes to align with `shadow-cljs` and `npm` while maintaining a `lein`-focus may
  be forthcoming. Thanks to [@thheller](https://github.com/thheller) for his input.
