# {{name}} Re-frame App

Run "`lein figwheel`" in a terminal to compile the app. Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

Any changes to ClojureScript source files (in `src`) will be reflected in the running page immediately (while "`lein figwheel`" is running).

Run "`lein clean; lein with-profile prod compile`" to compile an optimized version.
