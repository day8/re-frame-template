# re-frame

A Leiningen template for [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame).

## Usage

`lein new re-frame <project_name>`

## Source

This project is essentially a fork of https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-template amended for 
for re-frame.

But we're not religiously tracking reagent-template, so at any point this might be slightly out of date. So, keep an eye on the original.
